          <h3>Blossom</h3>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/erichocean/blossom">Blossom</a> is a modern, cross-platform application framework written entirely in JavaScript.
          <p>It builds off of SproutCore, the open source JavaScript application framework behind Appleâ€™s iCloud and iWork web application suites. Blossom extends the reach of traditional SproutCore applications beyond the web browser by re-architecting the view layer to be HTML and CSS-independent.
          <p>Blossom also extends the kinds of apps that can be written in JavaScript by implementing an easy-to-use, high-performance animation subsystem that leverages hardware acceleration on the GPU whenever possible. The API is roughly based on Apple's Core Animation framework, and provides similar capabilities &mdash; even in modern web browsers.
          <p>Since SproutCore's HTML and CSS dependencies were removed, Blossom can support native runtimes on the desktop (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) and on mobile devices (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone) and tablets (iOS, Android) -- and that's in addition to modern web browsers, all with the same API.

          <h3>SproutCore</h3>
          <p>I've also become an expert in both <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html">Cocoa</a> and  SproutCore while developing a workflow system for film production and pre-production. Although not my primary focus, I frequently help out the <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a> community.
          <p>In 2008-2009, I consulted with Apple on the transition from SproutCore 0.9 to 1.0 which entailed almost a complete rewrite of the codebase. I am still considered to be a SproutCore "thought leader", though I no longer guide SproutCore's day-to-day development. I have also trained and mentored companies and individuals on SproutCore throughout the world.
          <p>Looking for <a href="training/index.html">SproutCore Training<a/>? I regularly train new developers online with a 4-hour class.
          <p>I also lead a group of developers doing <a href="mentoring/index.html">SproutCore Mentoring<a/> for individuals and teams.
