          <h1>What if Avatar had a story supervisor?</h1>
          
          <p><em>Films should tell stories. Today they tell scripts. Story supervisors put the focus of filmmaking off the script and back onto the story where it belongs.</em>
          
          <p>"What does a live-action story supervisor actually do?" a friend of mine asked recently. The short answer, I said, is that they produce <em>live-action story reels</em>. "Yeah, I've heard you say that before" he replied. "But what do they actually <em>do</em>?" He wanted to know what the process was, and more importantly, why a film director would want to have one.
            
          <p>The  only live-action film in history that conceivably could have even used a story supervisor is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">James Cameron's Avatar</a>. That's because story reels &mdash; the primary work product of a story supervisor &mdash; require <a href="fohr/index.html">non-linear production</a> techniques, or as James Cameron calls it, "virtual cinematography" and "performance capture."
          
            <p>Avatar did not have a story supervisor. "So," my friend asked, "if James Cameron <em>had</em> hired a story supervisor on Avatar, what would that person have done?" Read on for my answer to that question.

          <h2>What a story supervisor actually does on a live-action film</h2>
          <p>The story supervisor job in live-action filmamking is similar in spirit and purpose to the job of the same name in animation, especially 3D animation. The actual job duties, however, are different.

          <p>The reason story supervisors exist is to extend what a director can do himself much earlier in the production process, well into the early stages of pre-production. A story supervisor is the "right hand" of the director, and has the same skillset as a director, but a more narrow focus of responsibilities.

          <p>A story supervisor is basically a director who doesn't direct &mdash; nothing final anyway. They work at a much faster pace, don't use the "real" actors, and don't even attempt to achieve "final" quality on anything they do. The name of the game is <em>speed</em>, and the goal is to validate the story that produced the script, and the script's specific embodiment of that story &mdash; and to do so as quickly as possible.
          
          <p>Story reels can determine, with very little cost and zero production delay, what <em>doesn't</em> work about a particular telling of a story, so that the problems can be addressed before final work is done. Later on, other benefits of story reels become available. But initially, <em>we just want to make sure the telling of the story works within the whole of the film.</em>

          <p>Avatar had been in production for over two years before there was a rough cut of the film available. Virtually everything had been shot already, in more or less "final" format. The result? A film that was over 40 minutes too long. Story reels would have caught that problem within the first three months, when there was still time to do something about it.

          <p>If I had been the story supervisor on Avatar, I would have been able to finish the first story reel for the entire film roughly three months after the script was complete. None my work would have been "final." The goal is only to validate the story – not develop amazing performances, camera work, etc. Even the art design will not be there, for the most part, since that is being developed at the same time.

          <h2>What to expect from the first full-length story reel</h2>
          <p>The very first full-length story reel is rougher than any rough cut for a live-action feature film. Nevertheless, a filmamker learns a lot.

          <ul>
          <li>What shots/sequences are going to be hard to do! A story supervisor speeds past any bumps, but that doesn't mean they won't know they are there.
          <li>How long the script will be in edited form with a straightforward, economical realization.
          <li>Which story ideas worked well, and which didn't work as well as hoped.
          <li>Whether the overall story is working as expected/desired.
          <li>What the key technical and story challenges are likely to be, along with ideas on how to overcome them.
          </ul>

          <p>The story reel is officially updated every three months or so thereafter, taking into account story revisions, art direction updates, more specific camera work (e.g. some sequences might work, but we can't tell because we didn't spend enough time on the camera, so a story supervisor would improve that aspect), and whatever else has been improved on the production since the last story reel. A production should see steady improvement on problem areas every three months.
            
          <p>For Avatar, which spent roughly two years in production, you would expect to see 6-8 major story reel revisions during the project, and countless revisions on specific subsequences. As pre-production moves on, the director can finalize aspects of the sequence &mdash; shot selection, lighting, blocking, sets, etc.

          <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> the story supervisor never does any work that is "final"; that is the job of the Director alone.</em>

          <p>Theoretically, there's nothing a story supervisor would do that James Camerion is not qualified to do himself. Rather, they are things he can't do <em>practically</em> because there simply isn't time. James Cameron should be doing everything that requires his input – directing final acting with the real performers, doing final camera work in the volume, working with the art department, the music, and yes, the story supervisor to vet the story plans put into place in the script. A story supervisor can skip a ton of meetings and work that only James Cameron can do. A story supervisor is like a super-charger for the director.

          <h2>Life without a story supervisor: a case study</h2>
          <p>On Avatar, the first story reel wasn't available until nearly 2.5 years into a four year process. Even worse, it contained final performances, final camera work and even a final rendered scene or two! That is <em>way</em> too far into the process to make high-quality story changes if the script is too long, or the pacing too inconsistent, or any other problem that could require structural changes. For example, when you are forced to cut for length, you oftentimes end up with story stuff weaved into scenes from plots no longer well-established, stuff that can't be easily removed. Those unremovable elements (which are no longer valuable, story-wise) are now crowding out valuable screen time for elements that you would have time for, but don't because it was wasted. The film as a whole suffers and since everything is "final", there's very little you can do to fix it at that point.

          <p>That's why Avatar would have benefited from a story supervisor.

          <p>Another reason to have a story supervisor is to avoid Director fatigue. Just like an actor has only so many good takes in them for a particular scene, I believe the same is true (to a different degree) with directors. It takes a lot of focus and energy to produce final-quality work in camera, lighting, and performance. A story supervisor can help you get the story feedback you need with very little energy and time. It's really not practical to expect a director to shoot the same scene over and over and over again, particularly when they have final shots in their mind already. But a story supervisor can, in the same way that a concept artist can provide you with dozens of concept drawings on the same subject. They don't feel the same stresses.

          <p>As a story supervisor, I'm not focused on any of the other details of the film – art direction, discussions with Weta, etc. I'm purely trying to get the story into story reel form so that you can vet it. I'm not producing anything final, so I can work much faster, knowing that everything I do will be redone properly by you at some point with the real actors. I only need to shoot enough to allow you and I to vet the story.

          <p>A story supervisor in live action is basically a norrmal director who doesn't direct final work – not lighting, not camera, and not performance. They need to understand the story much more than someone who simply reads the script (they should know, in particular, what the script is <em>supposed</em> to be accomplishing story-wise). But they can avoid much of the detail work that a director normally does, and instead, can focus their efforts on only the story issues the script presents.

          <p>Over time, the scenes and sequence in the story reel are revised, becoming closer to what the final film will be. At any point, the director can "work out" any scene or sequence to close to final form and cut that into the story reel.

          <p>Once we have a story reel to examine, it will become clearer which scenes and sequences contain "story risk" that should be evaluated sooner rather that later in more detail. We might walk through the scene more closely, you explaining how the performance capture should go – enough to get us, say, 90% of the way there. I would then go out, and again, with non-final actors, update the blocking and performance and sub in better camera work. You could then see stuff that was wrong and perhaps step out into the Volume and fix a camera shot on-the-fly that "solves" the story problem. Great, the story risk is now contained and we're onto other issues.

          <p>If we do this enough times, we'll have completed a substantial portion of the final camera work and be ready for performance capture and live action shooting – and do so with far more confidence about the story aspects of the film. The story will be well-vetted by that point, both for length, pacing and story content. Plot lines that had to be dropped will be removed entirely – from all scenes. You'll know which sequences need to move at particular paces in the script. Finally, you can avoid shooting entire scenes and sequences from the original script that have already been dropped as a result of the story reels. That leaves more time and money for the sequences we kept or added. It keeps our "A team" working on stuff that'll end up in theaters.

          <p>Finally, as story supervisor, it's my job to evaluate story issues that come out of the story reel process and figure out options for overcoming them. So long as I know the overall story goals you have set, it should be possible for me to provide potential solutions that you can either choose or use as a springboard for a solution you're more comfortable with. I'll be living and breathing the story aspects day in, day out.
